# Work Done in Codeclause
* I interned as a data scientist in oasis infobyte where i did many projects according to their task.
## My Projects
### 1. Fake News Detection
A king of yellow journalism, fake news is false information and hoaxes spread through social media and other online media to achieve a political agenda. In this data science project idea, we will use Python to build a model that can accurately detect whether a piece of news is real or fake. We'll build a TfidfVectorizer and use a PassiveAggressiveClassifier to classify news into "Real" and "Fake". We'll be using a dataset of shape and execute everything in Jupyter Lab.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is the act of analysing words to determine sentiments and opinions that may be positive or negative in polarity.

### 3. Detection of the Parkinson's Disease
Using this data science project, early predictions of Parkinson's disease can be made. The patients who are prone to getting the disease or show signs of getting affected by Parkinson's disease in the future can be notified and this way an improved health service can be given to a patient.

### 4. Prediction of the Next Word
A distinctive aspect of working on data science projects is that you get the freedom to create predictive type models. You must have noticed this while using Google Docs, WhatsApp, or even the Google search bar: all of these use the technique of predicting the next word by suggesting a new word after each new word you type.
